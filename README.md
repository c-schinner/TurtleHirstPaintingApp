# Hirst Painting Turtle App
The Hirst Painting Turtle App is a Python program that uses the Turtle graphics library to create an artwork inspired by the style of artist Damien Hirst. The app generates a grid of colorful dots, each with a random color selected from a predefined palette. The resulting image resembles Hirst's famous "spot paintings," showcasing an abstract and visually striking composition.

# Features
